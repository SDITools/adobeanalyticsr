feature/jwt-file
  - Changed from using a litany of environment variables to auth with JWT to
  a simpler JSON file-based approach.

hotfix/segment-rsids
  - There is now a second argument for Report Suite ID for `aw_segment_table`,
  which allows the user to specify a vector of RSIDs for which to search for
  the segment IDs when making pretty names.
