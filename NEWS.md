# adobeanalyticsr (development version)

# adobeanalyticsr 0.3.0

* Changed from using a litany of environment variables to authorize with JWT to 
a simpler JSON file-based approach. Instead of listing out each variable in the 
.Renviron file a JSON file is used.
* There is now a second argument for Report Suite ID for `aw_segment_table`,
which allows the user to specify a vector of RSIDs for which to search for
the segment IDs when making pretty names.
* Added functions to build segments, validate, and create them in Adobe 
Analytics.
  * `seg_verbs`
  * `seg_rule()`
  * `seg_con()`
  * `seg_seq()`
  * `seg_then()`
  * `seg_build()`
  * `seg_val()`

# adobeanalyticsr 0.2.1

* Added support for JWT Authentication
* Changed authentication process with new functions 
  * `aw_auth()` 
  * `aw_auth_with()`
  * `aw_auth_name()`
  * `aw_auth_path()`
* Added support for `aw_token()` function with life-cycle warning
* Added new function called `aw_segment_table()` which returns one or multiple segments and their corresponding metrics
* Cleanup and edits to the `aw_freeform_table()` function
* Token support updates for all api call functions.
* Removed `client_id` and `client_secret` from functions that were not using those variables even if defined in the arguments.
* Fixed a few bugs around api calls that returned NA 
* Added argument to the `aw_freeform_table()` function that will prevent metric and dimension validation check to run at the start of every function call. This will save users a small amount of time but could be significant in the long run.
* Added progress bar to `aw_freeform_table()` and re-calibrated the estimated finish time.
* Enhanced authorization retention by saving client ID and client secret in the session environment
* Killed global counter on short requests
* Removed the search clause restriction to enable "CONTAINS" to be understood as the default for `aw_freeform_report()` search arguments.
* Added search argument to recursive call
* Updated date_range argument to handle datetimes better
