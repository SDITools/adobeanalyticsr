\arguments{
\item{startDate}{Start date for the maximum of a 3 month period.}

\item{endDate}{End date for the maximum of a 3 month period.}

\item{login}{The login value of the user you want to filter logs by.}

\item{ip}{The IP address you want to filter logs by.}

\item{rsid}{The report suite ID you want to filter logs by.}

\item{eventType}{The numeric id for the event type you want to filter logs by. Leaving this blank returns
all events. See the \href{https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-2.0-apis/blob/master/usage-logs.md}{Usage Logs API Guide}
for a complete list of event types.}

\item{event}{The event description you want to filter logs by. No wildcards are permitted.}

\item{limit}{The number of results to return per page. This argument works in conjunction with the
\code{page} argument. The default is 10.}

\item{page}{The "page" of results to display. This works in conjunction with the \code{limit} argument and is
zero-based. For instance, if \code{limit = 20} and \code{page = 1}, the results returned would be 21 through 40.}

\item{debug}{Include the output and input of the api call in the console for debugging. Default is FALSE}

\item{company_id}{Company ID. If an environment variable called \code{AW_COMPANY_ID} exists in \code{.Renviron} or
elsewhere and no \code{company_id} argument is provided, then the \code{AW_COMPANY_ID} value will be used.
Use \code{\link{get_me}} to get a list of available \code{company_id} values.}
