#' Get list of segments
#'
#' Retrieve all segments
#'
#' @param company_id Company ID. If an environment variable called `AW_COMPANY_ID` exists in `.Renviron` or
#' elsewhere and no `company_id` argument is provided, then the `AW_COMPANY_ID` value will be used.
#' Use \code{\link{get_me}} to get a list of available `company_id` values.
#' @param rsids Filter the list to only include segments tied to a specified RSID or
#' list of RSIDs. Specify multiple RSIDs as a vector (i.e., "`rsids = c("rsid_1", rsid_2",...rsid_n")`").
#' Use \code{\link{aw_get_reportsuites}} to get a list of available `rsid` values.
#' @param segmentFilter Filter list to only include segments in the list of segment IDs (comma-delimited)
#' @param locale The locale that segment details should be returned in. The default is `en_US`.
#' @param name Filter the list to only include segments that contain the specified **name**.
#' This is case-insensitive and is a simple, single string match.
#' @param tagNames Filter the list to only include segments that contain one of the tags.
#' @param filterByPublishedSegments Filter the list to only include segments where the published field is set to one of the allowable values:
#' `all` (the default), `TRUE`, or `FALSE`.
#' @param limit The number of results to return per page. This argument works in conjunction with the
#' `page` argument. The default is 10.
#' @param page The "page" of results to display. This works in conjunction with the `limit` argument and is
#' zero-based. For instance, if `limit = 20` and `page = 1`, the results returned would be 21 through 40.
#' @param sortDirection The sort direction for the results: `ASC` (default) for ascending or `DESC` for
#' descending. (This is case insensitive, so `asc` and `desc` work as well.)
#' @param sortProperty The property to sort the results by. Currently available values are `id` (default), `name`,
#' and `modified_date`. Note that setting `expansion = modified` returns results with a column added called
#' `modified`, which is the last date the calculated metric was modified. When using this value for `sortProperty`,
#' though, the name of the argument is `modified_date`, because why would we expect locked-in consistency
#' from Adobe?
#' @param expansion Additional segment metadata fields to include in the results: `reportSuiteName`,
#' `ownerFullName`, `modified`, `tags`, `compatibility`, `definition`, `publishingStatus`, `definitionLastModified`,
#' and `categories`. This argument takes a single value (e.g., `expansion = "modified"`)
#' or a vector of values (e.g., `expansion = c("modified", "ownerFullName")`).
#' @param includeType Include additional segments not owned by the user. Available values are `all` (default),
#' `shared`, and `templates`. The `all` option takes precedence over "shared".
#' @param debug Include the output and input of the api call in the console for debugging. Default is FALSE
#'
#' @return A data frame of segments and their meta data.
#'
#' @export
